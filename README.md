Backend server for the Visiting Card project

The work of the this server is to store the data of the visiting-card-android App.The Tech Stack decided for this server is Django , so the main objective of is to create a Restful Web Service(Rest Api) in Django which should be able to perform operation like :-

* GET operation -To Retrieve data/Information and will return a list of visiting cards
* PUT operation - To modify an already stored Visiting Card
* POST operation - To store a new Visiting Card
* DELETE operation - To Delete a Visiting Card

This Restful Web Service(Rest Api) will be later on integrated with the Visiting Card App and will handle the complete backend of the visiting-card-android App.
